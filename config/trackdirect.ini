;; APRS Track Direct Configuration Example
;; This is an example configuration file, you need to do some modifications.

title="APRS Track Direct"
owner_name="Unknown"
owner_email="no@name.com"

[database]

;; Basic database settings
;; If using docker, set host to "db"
host="127.0.0.1"
database="trackdirect"
;; If using docker, activate username and set to "root"
;username="username"
password="foobar"
port="5432"

;; Settings for the remover script
days_to_save_position_data="10"
days_to_save_station_data="30"
days_to_save_weather_data="10"
days_to_save_telemetry_data="10"

;; If this setting is enabled, OGN stations that we are not allowed to reveal the identity of will be given a random name similar to "UNKNOWN123"
;; If disabled we will drop all packets regarding stations that we should not reveal the identity of.
save_ogn_stations_with_missing_identity="0"


[websocket_server]

;; Websocket server host
host="0.0.0.0"

;; Websocket server port, must be same as port specified in index.php (if not using a reverse proxy)
port="9000"

;; If you are using a reverse proxy you need to play with the "external_port" setting, otherwise it should be the same as "port"
external_port="9000"

;; Websocket server log output
error_log="~/trackdirect/server/log/wsserver_aprs.log"

;; Packets received more frequently than the configured frequency limit will be dropped (limit is specified in seconds)
;; This frequency limit is only refering to pakets that is received in real time from the filtered feed used by the websocket server
;; This frequency limit may be a bit more forgiving than the frequence limit on the collector.
;; When receiving data from the OGN network this needs to be about 15s or more.
frequency_limit="0"

;; First APRS IS server for the websocket server to connect to.
;; Important: Please set up your own APRS IS server, do not use a public server.
;; If using docker, set aprs_host1 to "aprsc"
aprs_host1="127.0.0.1"
aprs_port1="14580"

;; Important that you set the correct source, otherwise it might be handled incorrect
;; - Source Id 1: APRS-IS
;; - Source Id 2: CWOP
;; - Source Id 3: CBAPRS
;; - Source Id 4: HUBHAB
;; - Source Id 5: OGN
aprs_source_id1="1"

;; Second APRS IS server for the websocket server to connect to (only needed if you use multiple sources).
;; Important: Please set up your own APRS IS server, do not use a public server.
;aprs_host2="127.0.0.1"
;aprs_port2="14580"
;aprs_source_id2="2"

;; Allow time travel
;; Use this settings to disable/enable data requests with a time interval (this must be disabled for the OGN network)
allow_time_travel="0"

;; Max default time in minutes (how old packets that will be included in the response)
;; This setting should be no more than 1440 for for the OGN network.
max_default_time="1440"

;; Max time in minutes when filtering (how old packets that will be included in the response)
;; This setting should be no more than 1440 for for the OGN network.
max_filter_time="1440"

;; Time in minutes until idle client is disconnected
max_client_idle_time="60"

;; Max age in seconds for real time packets waiting to be sent to client (dropping packets if limit is excceded)
max_queued_realtime_packets="30"


[collector0]

;; If using docker, set host to "aprsc"
host="127.0.0.1"
port_full="10152"
port_filtered="14580"

;; Important that you set the correct source, otherwise it might be handled incorrect
;; - Source Id 1: APRS-IS
;; - Source Id 2: CWOP
;; - Source Id 3: CBAPRS
;; - Source Id 4: HUBHAB
;; - Source Id 5: OGN
source_id="1"

;; Your callsign and passcode
callsign="NOCALL"
passcode="-1"

;; Database inserts is done in batches
numbers_in_batch="50"

;; Packets received more frequently than the configured frequency limit will not be shown on map (limit is specified in seconds)
;; When receiving data from the OGN network this needs to be 20s or more.
;; If setting save_fast_packets to "0", packets that is received to frequently will not be save (useful for OGN, but not for APRS-IS).
frequency_limit="5"
save_fast_packets="1"

;; Collector error log
error_log="~/trackdirect/server/log/collector.log"


;; If you need to run multiple collectors you can add multiple collector sections
